		<h1>All about <em>Epstein</em></h1>
		<p><em>Epstein</em> is an app to help bands manage some of the more mundane aspects of running a band. It is named after the famed manager from the 1960's, who is best known for managing The Beatles.</p>
		<p>Getting useful info all in one place is <em>Epstein</em>'s main goal so there's never a question about where's the gig, when do we need to be there, what's the setlist? </p>
